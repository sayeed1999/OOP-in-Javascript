Object Oriented Programming

There are 4 principles of OOP:-

- Encapsulation - isolation like COVID-19 situation (v2.js fulfills encapsulation!)

- Inheritance - be smart, dont write repeated codes for parent & child (v2.js does not fufill inheritance)

  - inheritance also helps removing duplicate codes (this is proved!)
  - remove duplicates from class properties
  - remove duplicates from class methods!!!!!


- Polymorphism - one method or thing to have multiple purpose
 
  - compile-time or static Polymorphism (this doesn't occur in js)
  - run-time or dynamic Polymorphism


- Abstraction - hide implementation details (v4.js has abstraction!!!)
